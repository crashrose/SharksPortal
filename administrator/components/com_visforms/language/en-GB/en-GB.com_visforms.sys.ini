COM_VISFORMS_DESC="Visforms is a native form generator for Joomla! 2.5.x. <br />It allows you to generate forms without any programmation and makes a point of protecting your forms against spambots.<br /> It provides you with an adapted form of our Joomla! plugin spambotCheck. <br />Just install plg_visforms_spamcheck, that is attached in the installation zip file, and enable the plugin.<br />It gives you further on the option to save form data in database and to export saved data into csv format. <br />It works fundamentally similar to the famous CK Forms from Cookex Developpment Team so that you may even be able to import your CK Forms data from your Joomla 1.5 website."
